Breast cancer ranks second in mortality among women after lung cancer. According to clinical statistics, 1 out of every 8 women is diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. Nevertheless, periodic clinical examinations and self-tests help in its early detection, and thus significantly increase the chances of survival. Invasive detection methods cause tumor rupture, accelerating the spread of cancer to surrounding areas. Consequently, there is a need for a more reliable, fast, accurate and effective non-invasive cancer detection system (Selvathi, D & Aarthy Poornila, A. (2018). Deep learning methods for detecting breast cancer using medical image analysis).

Early detection may give patients more treatment options. To detect signs of cancer, breast tissue from a biopsy is stained to improve nuclei and cytoplasm for microscopic examination. Pathologists then evaluate the extent of any abnormal structural change to determine if there are tumors.

Architectural distortion is a very thin seal of breast tissue and may represent the earliest sign of cancer. Since radiologists are unlikely to notice this, over the years several approaches for early detection have been proposed, but none of them use deep learning methods.

In its Renaissance Age, Deep Learning became the leading branch of machine learning that has been used for more than 10 years in many sectors of human life, including healthcare, the key requirement of deep learning methods is the data that the Kaggle platform provides in this competition in the competition for solving histopathological diagnosis of cancer.
